@title[#:style favicon]{[Josh]}

Hi, I'm Josh (Zhuo Shi). I was born in 2015. I am a pupil now, but my
dad and myself don't see me just as a little boy and don't put any
restriction upon my learning, so we have learned a lot of things
together.

@jib-image[300]{img-kdr2-com/main/josh-2022.jpg}

I am:

@itemlist[

@item{A mathematics enthusiast who is always trying to explain or
model everything in math.}

@item{A bilingual (I speak Chinese and English), and may become a
polyglot someday.}

@item{An amateur real cuber - I had collected all the cubes used in
WCA events (actually, much more than that) and got the ability to
solve all of them. But I don't do blind solving and FMC very well.}

@item{An amateur MineCraft player, who mostly stays in creative mode.}

@codeblock[#:keep-lang-line? #f]{@file-content{me.rkt}}

I also know some programming languages, like Racket, Haskell, Python,
Javascript, and C/C++. But I'm still on the way of
learning. @hyperlink["https://kdr2.com/project/kittle-buffer.html"]{Kittle
Buffer} was the first project on which I collabrated with my dad, I
worked as a feature designer and tester in the process. We are also
planning to work on other projects not publicly released yet.

Sometimes I record videos about topics interest me, you may find these
videos on my
@hyperlink["https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpQgxhZoMr3DW8-qTDCDjuw"]{Youtube
channel} or @hyperlink["https://depot.kdr2.com/josh/videos/"]{here}.

I haven't learned to write articles yet, so my dad helped me write
most content of this site. My dad also wrote a few pages about me on
@hyperlink["https://kdr2.com"]{his website}, maybe you can find them
there.

@subsection{About this site}

This website is built using scribble, the documentation tool of
Racket. I choose this tool because that Racket (or Lisp) is one of my
most favourite programming languages, and it's also the reason why
this site is called @bold{Josh In Brackets}. You can find the source
of this site on
@hyperlink["https://github.com/JoshInBrackets/JoshInBrackets"]{GitHub}. You
can share this site with the QR code below easily:
